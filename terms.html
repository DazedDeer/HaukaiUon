        <ul>

        <h4>Third Party Sites</h4>

            we do not control, endorse or approve, and are not responsible for, the content on those websites. 
            We recommend that you make your own investigations with respect to the suitability of those websites.</p>
            
        <h4>What happens if we discontinue our website</h4>
        <p>We may, at any time and without notice to you, discontinue our website, in whole or in part. We may also 
            exclude any person from using our website, at any time and at our sole discretion. We are not responsible 
            for any Liability you may suffer arising from or in connection with any such discontinuance or exclusion.</p>
        
        <h4>Terminating these terms</h4>
        <p>These Terms are effective until terminated by us, which we may do at any time and without notice 
            to you. In the event of termination, all restrictions imposed on you by these Terms and 
            limitations of liability set out in these Terms will survive.</p>

        <h4>Dealing with a problem</h4>
        <p>If you would like to give us feedback, please contact us, we appreciate your input. In the event 
            of any dispute arising from, or in connection with, these Terms (Dispute), the party claiming 
            there is a Dispute must give written notice to the other party setting out the details of the 
            Dispute and proposing a resolution. Within 7 days after receiving the notice, the parties must, 
            by someone with authority to reach a resolution, meet at least once to attempt to resolve the 
            Dispute or agree on the method of resolving the Dispute by other means, in good faith. 
            All aspects of every such conference, except the fact of the occurrence of the conference, 
            will be privileged. If the parties do not resolve the Dispute, or (if the Dispute is not 
            resolved) agree on an alternate method to resolve the Dispute, within 21 days after receipt of 
            the notice, the Dispute may be referred by either party (by notice in writing to the other party) 
            to litigation. Nothing in this clause will operate to prevent a party from seeking urgent 
            injunctive or equitable relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. </p>

        <h4>If a part of these terms isn't right</h4>
        <p>If a provision of these Terms is held to be void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that 
            provision must be read down as narrowly as necessary to allow it to be valid or enforceable. If 
            it is not possible to read down a provision (in whole or in part), that provision (or that part 
            of that provision) is severed from these Terms without affecting the validity or enforceability 
            of the remainder of that provision or the other provisions in these Terms.</p>

        <h4>Which laws govern these terms of use</h4>
        <p>If you are in New Zealand and a consumer of products or services, you may have certain rights 
            and/or remedies under the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993. When a guarantee under the 
            Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 is breached, you may be entitled to a range of remedies. For the 
            avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude, restrict or modify a 
            consumer's rights under the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993.</p>
        <p>Your use of our website and these Terms are governed by the laws of New Zealand. You irrevocably and 
            unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts operating in New Zealand.</p> 
        <p>Our website may be accessed throughout New Zealand and overseas. We make no representation that our 
            website complies with the laws (including intellectual property laws) of any country outside New 
            Zealand. If you access our website from outside New Zealand, you do so at your own risk and are 
            responsible for complying with the laws of the jurisdiction where you access our website.</p>
